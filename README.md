My collection of solutions for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Javascript is the primary language Im using to solve the puzzles.

Adding Rust solutions as I progress with learning the language.

**The solutions might not be the most performant or shortest. But I do try to make them easy to understand**
